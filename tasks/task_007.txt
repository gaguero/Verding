# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Vector Database for Agent Memory
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up and implement the vector database using pgvector for the agent's hybrid memory system, supporting both dense and sparse vector search.
# Details:
1. Configure pgvector extension in Supabase
2. Create memory_chunks table with vector column
3. Implement embedding generation using OpenAI Ada-002
4. Create API endpoints for memory storage and retrieval
5. Implement hybrid search combining dense and sparse vectors
6. Create property-scoped memory access controls
7. Implement memory management (pruning, summarization)
8. Setup vector indexing for performance optimization

Use OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model for embeddings with 1536 dimensions. Implement HNSW indexing in pgvector for performance. Consider implementing a local sparse vector index for keyword search to complement the dense vectors.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test embedding generation with various text inputs
2. Validate vector storage and retrieval
3. Benchmark search performance with large datasets
4. Test property isolation in memory access
5. Verify hybrid search improves result quality
6. Test memory pruning and management
7. Validate index performance improvements

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up pgvector Extension [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure the pgvector extension in the PostgreSQL database to enable vector storage and operations.
### Details:
Ensure PostgreSQL is running, install the pgvector extension, and verify that vector data types and functions are available.

## 2. Design Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Define tables and relationships to store vectors, metadata, and associated entities for efficient retrieval and management.
### Details:
Create tables for embeddings, metadata, and any related entities. Specify appropriate data types, constraints, and indexes for optimal performance.

## 3. Implement Embedding Generation Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Develop or integrate a pipeline to generate dense and/or sparse embeddings from raw data (e.g., text, images).
### Details:
Select or build embedding models, process input data, and store generated embeddings in the database according to the schema.

## 4. Develop API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Create RESTful or GraphQL API endpoints for CRUD operations, embedding uploads, and search queries.
### Details:
Implement endpoints for inserting, updating, deleting, and querying vectors and metadata. Ensure endpoints are documented and tested.

## 5. Implement Hybrid Search Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Enable combined dense and sparse vector search, supporting both similarity and keyword-based queries.
### Details:
Integrate ANN algorithms and traditional search methods to allow hybrid queries. Optimize for speed and accuracy.

## 6. Configure Access Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Set up authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to data and API endpoints based on user roles and properties.
### Details:
Implement role-based access control, property-scoped permissions, and secure API authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT).

## 7. Optimize Memory Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.5
### Description: Tune database and application settings to efficiently handle large volumes of vector data and queries.
### Details:
Adjust PostgreSQL memory parameters, batch processing strategies, and caching mechanisms to ensure scalability and performance.

## 8. Design and Build Indexing Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.5, 7.7
### Description: Implement and test vector indexing algorithms (e.g., HNSW, LSH, PQ) to accelerate similarity search operations.
### Details:
Evaluate and deploy appropriate indexing methods for the use case, monitor index performance, and automate index maintenance.
