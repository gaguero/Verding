# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Knowledge Base Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 13, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the knowledge base system for organizing, indexing, and retrieving information for the agent.
# Details:
1. Create knowledge organization system
2. Implement automatic categorization
3. Create semantic indexing with vector embeddings
4. Implement relationship mapping
5. Create tag management system
6. Implement RAG-based retrieval for agent
7. Create source attribution and confidence scoring
8. Develop knowledge analytics and reporting

Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using vector embeddings. Create chunking strategies that balance context preservation with retrieval precision. Implement hybrid search combining dense vectors with sparse keyword matching for optimal results.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test knowledge organization
2. Validate automatic categorization
3. Test semantic indexing and retrieval
4. Verify relationship mapping
5. Test tag management
6. Validate RAG-based agent responses
7. Test source attribution accuracy
8. Verify analytics and reporting

# Subtasks:
## 1. Organize Knowledge Base Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the hierarchical structure for the knowledge base, including sections, categories, and article templates.
### Details:
Define main categories, subcategories, and article types. Establish guidelines for content placement and navigation.

## 2. Implement Content Categorization [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Develop and apply a robust categorization system for all knowledge base entries to ensure easy retrieval and logical grouping.
### Details:
Create metadata fields for categories, assign articles to categories, and ensure consistency across the knowledge base.

## 3. Develop Semantic Indexing [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Integrate semantic indexing capabilities to enable advanced search and contextual understanding of knowledge base content.
### Details:
Leverage NLP techniques to extract entities, concepts, and relationships for improved search relevance.

## 4. Map Relationships Between Articles [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Establish and visualize relationships between articles, such as references, dependencies, and related topics.
### Details:
Implement linking mechanisms and relationship graphs to enhance navigation and discovery.

## 5. Design Tag Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Create a flexible tag management system to allow dynamic labeling and filtering of knowledge base content.
### Details:
Enable users to add, edit, and remove tags; enforce tag governance and prevent duplication.

## 6. Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3, 25.5
### Description: Implement RAG pipelines to enable AI-driven retrieval and generation of answers using the knowledge base.
### Details:
Connect semantic search with generative models to provide contextually accurate responses.

## 7. Enable Source Attribution [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all knowledge base content and AI-generated responses include clear source attribution for transparency.
### Details:
Track and display original sources for articles and referenced content in generated outputs.

## 8. Implement Analytics and Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop analytics dashboards to monitor usage, search trends, content gaps, and user engagement within the knowledge base.
### Details:
Collect and visualize metrics such as article views, search queries, and feedback to inform continuous improvement.
