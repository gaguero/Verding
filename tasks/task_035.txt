# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 27, 28
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize performance across the platform to meet response time and scalability requirements.
# Details:
1. Implement database query optimization
2. Create API response caching
3. Implement frontend performance optimization
4. Create asset optimization and delivery
5. Implement lazy loading and code splitting
6. Create database indexing strategy
7. Implement connection pooling and optimization
8. Develop performance monitoring and alerting

Optimize database queries with proper indexing and query planning. Implement caching strategies for API responses with appropriate invalidation. Create frontend performance optimizations with code splitting, tree shaking, and lazy loading. Implement proper asset optimization with compression and CDN delivery.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct performance benchmarking
2. Validate query optimization
3. Test caching effectiveness
4. Verify frontend performance metrics
5. Test asset delivery optimization
6. Validate lazy loading and code splitting
7. Test database performance under load
8. Verify monitoring and alerting

# Subtasks:
## 1. Query Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and optimize database queries to reduce execution time and resource usage.
### Details:
Review slow queries, add appropriate indexes, refactor inefficient SQL, and use query profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.

## 2. API Caching Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Implement caching strategies for API responses to reduce backend load and improve response times.
### Details:
Determine cacheable endpoints, select appropriate caching mechanisms (in-memory, distributed), and set cache invalidation policies.

## 3. Frontend Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2
### Description: Optimize frontend code and resources to minimize load times and improve user experience.
### Details:
Minify and bundle CSS/JS, remove unused code, optimize images, and ensure efficient rendering paths.

## 4. Asset Delivery Enhancement [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.3
### Description: Improve the delivery of static assets using techniques such as CDNs and compression.
### Details:
Configure CDN for static files, enable gzip or Brotli compression, and ensure assets are served with optimal cache headers.

## 5. Lazy Loading Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.4
### Description: Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources to reduce initial page load times.
### Details:
Apply lazy loading to images, videos, and code modules using native browser features or JavaScript libraries.

## 6. Indexing Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Design and implement effective indexing strategies for databases to speed up data retrieval.
### Details:
Analyze query patterns, create or adjust indexes, and monitor index usage for ongoing optimization.

## 7. Connection Pooling Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize database and API connection pooling to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
### Details:
Configure pool sizes, timeouts, and resource limits to balance performance and resource consumption.

## 8. Performance Monitoring and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.5, 35.7
### Description: Set up monitoring and validation tools to track performance improvements and detect regressions.
### Details:
Implement APM tools, set up dashboards, define key metrics, and establish alerting for performance anomalies.
