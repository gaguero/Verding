# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Multi-Property Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core multi-property management system that enables users to manage multiple farms/locations from a single instance.
# Details:
1. Implement property creation and management
2. Create hierarchical property organization
3. Implement property metadata management
4. Create user-property assignment system
5. Implement role-based permissions per property
6. Create property switching and context persistence
7. Implement cross-property operations and analytics
8. Develop property-specific settings and configurations

Implement a hierarchical structure that allows properties to have parent-child relationships. Create a context system that maintains the current property in all operations. Implement proper RLS policies at the database level to enforce property isolation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test property creation and editing
2. Validate hierarchical organization
3. Test user-property assignments
4. Verify role-based permissions
5. Test property switching and context
6. Validate cross-property operations
7. Test property-specific settings
8. Verify data isolation between properties

# Subtasks:
## 1. Property Creation Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core property creation system that supports multi-tenant architecture
### Details:
Develop a scalable property creation system that allows for efficient resource sharing across multiple properties while maintaining data isolation between tenants. Include property templates, validation rules, and initialization processes.

## 2. Hierarchical Property Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Implement a flexible hierarchy system for organizing properties in parent-child relationships
### Details:
Create a data model that supports nested property relationships (e.g., portfolio > building > unit). Design APIs for traversing, querying, and maintaining these relationships while ensuring performance at scale.

## 3. Property Metadata Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop a comprehensive metadata system for properties with customizable fields
### Details:
Build a flexible metadata framework allowing different property types to have unique attributes while maintaining a consistent core structure. Include support for custom fields, validation rules, and metadata inheritance within the property hierarchy.

## 4. User Assignment System [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Create a system for assigning users to properties with appropriate roles
### Details:
Implement user-to-property mapping functionality that supports both direct assignments and inheritance through the property hierarchy. Include bulk assignment capabilities and audit logging for assignment changes.

## 5. Role-Based Access Control [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.4
### Description: Design and implement RBAC system for granular permission management across properties
### Details:
Develop a comprehensive permission system that controls access at both the feature and data level. Ensure the system can handle complex scenarios like delegated administration and temporary access grants while maintaining security isolation between tenants.

## 6. Context Switching Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2, 17.4
### Description: Create intuitive UI components for users to navigate between properties
### Details:
Design and implement UI elements that allow users to easily switch between properties they have access to. Include features like favorites, recent properties, and search functionality while ensuring the system maintains proper context across navigation events.

## 7. Cross-Property Analytics Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2, 17.3, 17.5
### Description: Develop analytics capabilities that work across the property hierarchy
### Details:
Build a reporting and analytics system that can aggregate data across multiple properties while respecting user permissions. Include customizable dashboards, scheduled reports, and data export capabilities that maintain tenant isolation.

## 8. Property Settings Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.3
### Description: Implement a comprehensive settings system for property configuration
### Details:
Create a flexible settings framework that allows configuration at different levels of the property hierarchy with inheritance capabilities. Include validation, versioning, and audit logging for configuration changes.
