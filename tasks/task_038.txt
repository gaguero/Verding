## 5. Develop Continuity Planning [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.4
### Description: Create a business continuity plan outlining how essential operations will continue during and after a disaster.
### Details:
Identify critical business functions, define RTOs and RPOs, and document alternative workflows.

## 6. Define Incident Response Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.5
### Description: Establish clear incident response protocols for disaster scenarios, including detection, escalation, communication, and initial containment.
### Details:
Assign roles, create communication templates, and integrate with continuity and restoration plans.

## 7. Set Up Recovery Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement monitoring and reporting mechanisms to track recovery progress, system health, and compliance with recovery objectives.
