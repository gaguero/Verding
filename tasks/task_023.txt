# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Delivery Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8, 21, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the delivery management system for route optimization, scheduling, and status tracking.
# Details:
1. Create delivery data model and management
2. Implement route optimization algorithm
3. Create delivery scheduling system
4. Implement status update and tracking
5. Create proof of delivery handling
6. Implement delivery analytics and reporting
7. Create notification system for delivery events
8. Develop delivery template management

Implement a route optimization system that minimizes travel time and maximizes delivery efficiency. Create scheduling tools that balance delivery capacity with order volumes. Implement proof of delivery capture with photo and signature options.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test delivery creation and management
2. Validate route optimization algorithm
3. Test scheduling system
4. Verify status updates and tracking
5. Test proof of delivery handling
6. Validate analytics and reporting
7. Test notification system
8. Verify template management

# Subtasks:
## 1. Data Modeling for Delivery Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the data models required to support delivery management, including entities for orders, drivers, routes, delivery status, and proof of delivery.
### Details:
Define database schema, relationships, and data validation rules to ensure all delivery-related data is structured and accessible.

## 2. Route Optimization Algorithm Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Develop and integrate algorithms to optimize delivery routes based on factors such as distance, traffic, delivery windows, and vehicle capacity.
### Details:
Research and select appropriate optimization techniques (e.g., shortest path, TSP, VRP), implement the logic, and test with sample data.

## 3. Delivery Scheduling System [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Create a scheduling system to assign deliveries to drivers and vehicles, considering route optimization results and delivery constraints.
### Details:
Develop logic for time slot allocation, driver availability, and dynamic rescheduling in response to real-time changes.

## 4. Status Tracking Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.3
### Description: Implement mechanisms to track the real-time status of deliveries, including location updates, delivery progress, and exception handling.
### Details:
Integrate GPS tracking, status update endpoints, and dashboards for monitoring delivery progress.

## 5. Proof of Delivery Capture [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.4
### Description: Develop features to capture and store proof of delivery, such as signatures, photos, or QR code scans, and associate them with delivery records.
### Details:
Design user interfaces and backend endpoints for drivers to submit proof, and ensure secure storage and retrieval.

## 6. Analytics and Reporting Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.4, 23.5
### Description: Build analytics tools to generate insights on delivery performance, route efficiency, driver productivity, and customer satisfaction.
### Details:
Design dashboards, KPIs, and exportable reports using collected delivery data.

## 7. Notification System Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.3, 23.4
### Description: Implement a notification system to inform stakeholders (customers, drivers, admins) about delivery status, scheduling changes, and exceptions.
### Details:
Support multiple channels (SMS, email, push), customizable templates, and real-time triggers.

## 8. Template Management for Communications [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a template management system for all delivery-related communications, enabling easy customization and localization.
### Details:
Allow admins to create, edit, and assign templates for notifications, receipts, and proof of delivery messages.
