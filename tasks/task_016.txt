# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement BuJo Task Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Bullet Journal-inspired task management system for tracking operations and activities across properties.
# Details:
1. Design task data model with BuJo notation support
2. Implement task creation via natural language
3. Create task migration and rescheduling
4. Implement priority management system
5. Create task dependency tracking
6. Implement recurring task patterns
7. Create task completion and verification
8. Develop task analytics and reporting

Implement the core BuJo concepts of tasks (•), events (○), and notes (—) with appropriate extensions for agricultural operations. Support task migration (>) and scheduling (< date) notation. Create a natural language parser for converting phrases like "water trays tomorrow morning" into structured tasks.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test task creation with various notations
2. Validate natural language parsing accuracy
3. Test task migration and rescheduling
4. Verify priority management
5. Test dependency tracking and validation
6. Validate recurring task generation
7. Test completion and verification workflows
8. Verify reporting and analytics accuracy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Core Data Model for BuJo System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define entities and relationships for tasks, logs (daily, weekly, monthly), collections, and metadata to support BuJo features.
### Details:
Include fields for task content, status (open, completed, migrated, scheduled), priority, dependencies, recurrence, and timestamps.

## 2. Implement Natural Language Parsing for Task Input [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop NLP routines to extract task details (title, date, priority, recurrence, dependencies) from user input.
### Details:
Support rapid-logging style input and recognize migration, scheduling, and completion cues.

## 3. Develop Migration and Rescheduling Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Enable tasks to be migrated between logs (daily, weekly, monthly, future) and rescheduled as per BuJo conventions.
### Details:
Implement rules for marking tasks as migrated, updating their log association, and reflecting changes in the data model.

## 4. Implement Priority Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Allow users to assign and modify task priorities, and ensure priority is reflected in task sorting and analytics.
### Details:
Support multiple priority levels and visual indicators in the UI.

## 5. Enable Task Dependency Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Allow tasks to reference other tasks as dependencies, preventing completion until prerequisites are met.
### Details:
Update data model and UI to visualize and enforce dependencies.

## 6. Support Recurring Tasks [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Implement logic for creating, tracking, and auto-generating recurring tasks based on user-defined intervals.
### Details:
Handle recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly) and ensure proper migration and completion handling.

## 7. Implement Task Completion Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.5
### Description: Allow users to mark tasks as completed, update status, and trigger any post-completion logic (e.g., analytics, dependency updates).
### Details:
Ensure completion is reflected in all relevant logs and analytics.

## 8. Develop Analytics and Reporting Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7
### Description: Provide insights on task completion rates, migration frequency, priority distribution, and productivity trends.
### Details:
Generate visualizations and summaries to help users reflect and plan.
