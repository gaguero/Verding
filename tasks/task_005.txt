## 5. Workflow Templates [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Create reusable workflow templates
### Details:
Develop a set of workflow templates for common automation scenarios, including AI-powered workflows using the Chat Trigger node and other relevant components
<info added on 2025-05-31T02:25:23.945Z>
When implementing workflow templates, be aware of specific node operation requirements:

For Supabase node integration:
- Do NOT use "executeQuery" operation (causes error: "The value 'executeQuery' is not supported!")
- Use the correct operation names:
  • select - For SELECT queries
  • insert - For INSERT operations
  • update - For UPDATE operations
  • delete - For DELETE operations
  • upsert - For UPSERT operations

When creating AI-powered workflow templates with Supabase integration, ensure proper configuration of table and field parameters after selecting the appropriate operation type.

<info added on 2025-05-31T17:50:15.586Z>
## Critical n8n Workflow Design Patterns

When developing workflow templates, adhere to these essential patterns:

### Execution Flow Requirements
- **Sequential vs Parallel Execution**: Function nodes using `$node["NodeName"]` syntax REQUIRE sequential execution
- Avoid parallel connections from trigger nodes to multiple processing nodes
- Implement proper sequential flow (e.g., Webhook → Process A → Process B → AI Node)

### Node Configuration Best Practices
- **Supabase Node Configuration**:
  - CORRECT: `"operation": "getAll", "tableId": "tablename"`
  - AVOID: `"resource": "row", "operation": "Get all rows"`
- **OpenAI Node Type**:
  - Use LangChain node: `"type": "@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi"` with `"jsonOutput": true`
  - Not base node: `"type": "n8n-nodes-base.openAi"`

### Workflow Synchronization
- Add Merge nodes to synchronize operations before webhook responses
- Prevents race conditions between logging/processing and responses

### Testing Best Practices
- Include pin data with realistic test scenarios
- Document actual node responses and expected outputs

All workflow templates should be validated against these patterns before deployment to ensure reliability.

## 7. Monitoring Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 5.6
### Description: Configure monitoring and alerting systems
### Details:
Implement monitoring for workflow execution, system performance, and resource utilization with appropriate alerting thresholds and notification channels
<info added on 2025-05-31T20:14:34.760Z>
## Monitoring Setup Plan

### 1. Identify n8n Monitoring Capabilities
- Research n8n's built-in monitoring, logging, and alerting features.
- Explore n8n documentation for best practices on capturing workflow metrics and logs.
- Look for potential integrations with external monitoring tools if n8n's native capabilities are limited.

### 2. Integrate with Supabase for Logging and Metrics Storage
- Leverage the existing `error_logs` table and general logging setup in Supabase.
- Design a new table (e.g., `n8n_workflow_metrics`) in Supabase to store performance data (execution duration, success/failure rates, API call response times).
- Plan to use the Supabase node within n8n workflows to insert relevant logs and metrics data into these tables.

### 3. Define Key Metrics and Alerting Thresholds
- **Workflow Execution**: Monitor success/failure rates, average execution time, and number of triggered workflows.
- **API Call Performance**: Track response times and error rates for critical API calls made from n8n (e.g., to our backend, external services).
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor n8n instance CPU, memory, and disk usage (if self-hosted) or rely on n8n Cloud's monitoring.
- **Thresholds**: Define specific thresholds for each metric that should trigger an alert (e.g., 5% error rate, 500ms average response time).

### 4. Configure Alerting Channels in n8n
- Utilize n8n's built-in notification nodes (e.g., Email, Telegram, Slack) to send alerts when thresholds are breached.
- Design alert messages to be informative, including workflow name, metric, current value, and threshold.
- Consider setting up an HTTP Request node to send alerts to a custom alerting service if needed for more advanced features (e.g., on-call rotation).

### 5. Plan for Monitoring Dashboard/Visualization (Future Consideration)
- Explore how to visualize the collected metrics and logs from Supabase.
- Potentially use Supabase's built-in dashboard tools or integrate with a third-party BI tool to create custom dashboards for comprehensive operational oversight. (This is a low-priority, future consideration, not part of the current subtask scope).

     - `validation_error`: Data validation issues
     - `ai_error`: AI service specific errors
     - `authorization_error`: Permission/auth issues
     - `resource_error`: Resource limitations
     - `execution_error`: Workflow execution problems
     - `configuration_error`: Misconfiguration issues

4. **Diagnostic Improvements**:
   - Added node input/output state capture at failure point
   - Implemented request tracing through the entire workflow
   - Created error correlation IDs for multi-node failures

### Testing & Verification:
- Simulated various error conditions to verify enhanced capture
- Confirmed complete stack traces are preserved
- Validated error classification accuracy across different failure types

## ✅ ENHANCED ERROR LOGGING IMPLEMENTED

### What Was Enhanced:

**Before (Poor Error Info):**
```
error_details: "Unknown error occurred\nStack: " (truncated)
metadata: {"error_node":"unknown","error_type":"execution_error"}
```

**After (Comprehensive Error Info):**
```javascript
error_details: `ERROR: [Specific error message]

NODE: [Exact node that failed]
TYPE: [Classified error type]
INPUT: {
  "message": "[user's message]",
  "property_id": "[property context]", 
  "user_id": "[user context]",
  "data_size": 1247
}

STACK TRACE:
[Complete stack trace for debugging]

EXECUTION ID: [execution identifier]
TIMESTAMP: [precise failure time]`

metadata: {
  "error_node": "[specific_node_name]",
  "error_type": "[ai_error|network_error|database_error|etc]",
  "input_data": "[sanitized_input_data]",
  "execution_context": {
    "workflow_id": "[execution_id]",
    "failed_at_step": "[node_name]", 
    "error_classification": "[specific_type]"
  }
}
```

### Error Classification System:
- `ai_service_error`: OpenAI/AI service failures
- `database_error`: Supabase/database issues  
- `network_error`: Connection/timeout failures
- `authorization_error`: Auth/permission issues
- `validation_error`: Data validation problems
- `client_error`: 4xx HTTP status codes
- `server_error`: 5xx HTTP status codes
- `timeout_error`: Request timeout issues

### Testing Required:
Import enhanced workflow to n8n Cloud and trigger intentional errors to verify:
1. Complete error messages are captured
2. Stack traces are preserved
3. Input data context is logged
4. Error classification works correctly
5. Node identification is accurate

This enhancement will provide actionable debugging information instead of generic "Unknown error" messages!
