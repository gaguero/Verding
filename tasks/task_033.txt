# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement Security Features and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement security features, compliance mechanisms, and data protection measures across the platform.
# Details:
1. Implement input validation across all endpoints
2. Create SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
3. Implement XSS prevention with Content Security Policy
4. Create CSRF protection with token validation
5. Implement proper encryption for sensitive data
6. Create compliance reporting for GAP requirements
7. Implement data retention policies
8. Develop security monitoring and alerting

Implement comprehensive security measures following OWASP best practices. Create proper input validation with Zod or similar. Implement Content Security Policy headers to prevent XSS attacks. Create token-based CSRF protection for all state-changing operations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct security penetration testing
2. Validate input sanitization
3. Test SQL injection prevention
4. Verify XSS protection
5. Test CSRF protection
6. Validate encryption implementation
7. Test compliance reporting
8. Verify security monitoring

# Subtasks:
## 1. Input Validation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement robust input validation mechanisms across all user input points to prevent malicious data from entering the system.
### Details:
Define validation rules for each input type, sanitize and validate data on both client and server sides, and ensure error handling does not leak sensitive information.

## 2. SQL Injection Prevention [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Integrate measures to prevent SQL injection attacks in all database interactions.
### Details:
Use parameterized queries or prepared statements, avoid dynamic SQL where possible, and regularly review code for injection vulnerabilities.

## 3. XSS Prevention [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Implement controls to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications.
### Details:
Escape user-generated content before rendering, use Content Security Policy (CSP), and validate and sanitize all outputs.

## 4. CSRF Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Deploy mechanisms to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
### Details:
Implement anti-CSRF tokens, enforce same-site cookies, and validate the origin of requests for sensitive operations.

## 5. Encryption Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure encryption is applied to sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
### Details:
Use industry-standard encryption algorithms, manage keys securely, and enforce HTTPS/TLS for all communications.

## 6. Compliance Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.2, 33.3, 33.4, 33.5
### Description: Develop and automate compliance reporting processes to meet regulatory requirements.
### Details:
Generate regular reports on security controls, incidents, and compliance status for internal and external stakeholders.

## 7. Data Retention Policy Enforcement [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.5
### Description: Establish and enforce data retention and deletion policies in accordance with compliance standards.
### Details:
Define retention periods for different data types, automate data deletion, and document procedures for audits.

## 8. Continuous Security Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.2, 33.3, 33.4, 33.5
### Description: Implement continuous monitoring of systems and processes to detect and respond to security incidents.
### Details:
Deploy monitoring tools, set up alerting for suspicious activities, and regularly review logs and incident reports.
