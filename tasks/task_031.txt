# Task ID: 31
# Title: Implement Sensor Monitoring Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 14, 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the sensor monitoring interface for visualizing environmental data, alerts, and compliance records.
# Details:
1. Create sensor dashboard interface
2. Implement real-time data visualization
3. Create historical data charts
4. Implement alert configuration and display
5. Create compliance record generation
6. Implement sensor health monitoring
7. Create data export and reporting
8. Develop anomaly detection visualization

Create interactive charts for visualizing sensor data using Recharts or D3.js. Implement real-time updates with appropriate throttling to prevent performance issues. Create compliance reports that meet GAP requirements with proper formatting and signatures.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test sensor dashboard interface
2. Validate real-time visualization
3. Test historical data charts
4. Verify alert configuration and display
5. Test compliance record generation
6. Validate sensor health monitoring
7. Test data export and reporting
8. Verify anomaly detection visualization

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Sensor Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dashboard interface to provide an overview of sensor states, including quick status, grouping by state, and customizable widgets for different users or departments.
### Details:
The dashboard should display sensor summaries, allow user-defined layouts, and support interactive controls for device management.

## 2. Develop Real-Time Data Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Implement real-time visualization of sensor data using dynamic charts and widgets that update as new data arrives.
### Details:
Use WebSockets or similar technologies to push live sensor readings to the dashboard, ensuring immediate feedback and visibility.

## 3. Build Historical Data Charting [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Enable visualization of historical sensor data with time-series charts, supporting zoom, pan, and selectable time ranges.
### Details:
Store sensor readings with timestamps and provide interactive charts for users to analyze trends and past events.

## 4. Implement Alerting and Notification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.2, 31.3
### Description: Set up configurable alert thresholds for sensor values and deliver notifications when thresholds are breached.
### Details:
Allow users to define alert levels (e.g., low, medium, high) and receive real-time alerts via dashboard, email, or SMS.

## 5. Maintain Compliance and Audit Records [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.3, 31.4
### Description: Log sensor data and alert events for compliance, including audit trails and exportable records for regulatory purposes.
### Details:
Ensure all relevant sensor and alert data is securely stored and can be retrieved or exported for compliance audits.

## 6. Monitor Sensor Health and Availability [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Track sensor uptime, data validity, and fault history to assess sensor health and reliability.
### Details:
Display health metrics such as data availability percentage, valid data percentage, and recent fault logs on the dashboard.

## 7. Enable Data Export and Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.3, 31.5
### Description: Provide options to export sensor data and generate reports in formats like CSV, PDF, or Excel for further analysis.
### Details:
Allow users to select time ranges and data types for export, and automate scheduled report generation if needed.

## 8. Integrate Anomaly Detection Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.2, 31.3, 31.4
### Description: Develop and deploy algorithms to detect anomalies in sensor data, triggering alerts and highlighting unusual patterns.
### Details:
Use statistical or machine learning methods to identify deviations from normal sensor behavior and visualize anomalies on the dashboard.
