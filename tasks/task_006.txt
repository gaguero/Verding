# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the Model Context Protocol tools that enable structured communication between the agent and backend systems.
# Details:
1. Design JSON-RPC style protocol for tool invocation
2. Implement core MCP handler in backend
3. Create tool registration system
4. Develop property context awareness in tool execution
5. Implement error handling and response formatting
6. Create tool categories based on functional areas
7. Document tool specifications for n8n integration
8. Implement rate limiting and security controls

The MCP should support the 140+ tools mentioned in the PRD, organized into 14 functional categories. Each tool should follow a consistent pattern with:
- Name and description
- Input parameters with validation
- Output schema
- Error handling
- Property context requirements

# Test Strategy:
1. Test tool registration and discovery
2. Validate input parameter validation
3. Test property context enforcement
4. Verify error handling with invalid inputs
5. Test rate limiting and throttling
6. Benchmark tool execution performance
7. Validate security controls prevent unauthorized access

# Subtasks:
## 1. Protocol Specification Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the MCP communication protocol, including message formats, request/response structures, and capability discovery mechanisms.
### Details:
Establish the standard for how Hosts, Clients, and Servers interact, ensuring extensibility and modularity for future tool integrations.

## 2. Handler Interface Definition [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Design and document the handler interfaces for tool invocation, including input validation, execution, and response formatting.
### Details:
Specify how each tool handler should process requests and return results in compliance with the MCP protocol.

## 3. Tool Registration Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement a system for registering and discovering tools and their capabilities within MCP servers.
### Details:
Enable dynamic discovery and listing of available tools, supporting capability queries from clients.

## 4. Context Awareness Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Develop mechanisms for passing and utilizing contextual information (user, session, environment) during tool invocation.
### Details:
Ensure handlers can access relevant context to provide accurate and personalized responses.

## 5. Error Handling Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Design and implement a robust error handling and reporting system for protocol violations, tool failures, and unexpected conditions.
### Details:
Standardize error codes, messages, and recovery strategies across all MCP components.

## 6. Tool Categorization Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Define and implement a categorization and metadata schema for tools to support discovery, filtering, and organization.
### Details:
Establish categories, tags, and descriptive metadata for each tool to enhance usability and integration.

## 7. Documentation and Developer Guides [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6
### Description: Produce comprehensive documentation covering protocol usage, handler implementation, registration, and integration best practices.
### Details:
Include code samples, API references, and troubleshooting guides for developers.

## 8. Rate Limiting and Quota Enforcement [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.5
### Description: Implement rate limiting and quota management for tool invocations to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage.
### Details:
Support configurable limits per tool, user, or session, with appropriate error responses when limits are exceeded.

## 9. Security and Access Control [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.8
### Description: Design and enforce authentication, authorization, and secure communication mechanisms for all MCP components.
### Details:
Ensure only authorized clients and users can access specific tools and data, and all data exchanges are encrypted.

## 10. Integration and End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.8, 6.9
### Description: Develop and execute comprehensive integration tests covering protocol compliance, handler correctness, security, and performance.
### Details:
Validate that all components interoperate as expected and meet reliability and scalability requirements.
