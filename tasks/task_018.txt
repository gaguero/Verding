# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Sowing Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the sowing management system for tracking batches, resources, and timelines for microgreens production.
# Details:
1. Create batch data model and management
2. Implement seed and resource calculation
3. Create timeline and scheduling system
4. Implement yield prediction algorithms
5. Create batch tracking and status updates
6. Implement resource inventory management
7. Create batch labeling and identification
8. Develop batch analytics and reporting

Implement a comprehensive batch tracking system that follows microgreens from seed to harvest. Create resource calculations based on tray size, seed density, and growing medium. Implement predictive models for yield based on historical data.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test batch creation and management
2. Validate resource calculations
3. Test timeline and scheduling
4. Verify yield prediction accuracy
5. Test batch status updates
6. Validate inventory management
7. Test batch labeling and identification
8. Verify analytics and reporting

# Subtasks:
## 1. Batch Modeling Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and configure batch models for sowing management, including batch size, timing, and grouping logic.
### Details:
Establish the parameters for batch management, such as sow groups, batch intervals, and system type (e.g., all-in/all-out).

## 2. Resource Calculation [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Calculate the required resources for each batch, including space, equipment, and labor.
### Details:
Determine the number of spaces, rooms, and equipment needed for each batch based on the modeled parameters and farm size.

## 3. Batch Scheduling [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Develop a detailed schedule for all sowing-related tasks across batches.
### Details:
Create a work schedule that aligns batch activities (e.g., sowing, weaning, mating) with resource availability and operational constraints.

## 4. Yield Prediction Modeling [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.3
### Description: Implement predictive models to estimate expected yields for each batch.
### Details:
Use historical data and batch parameters to forecast yields, considering variables like weaning age and sow introduction rates.

## 5. Batch Tracking Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.3
### Description: Set up systems to track the progress and status of each batch throughout the sowing process.
### Details:
Enable real-time monitoring of batch status, including task completion, deviations, and key performance indicators.

## 6. Inventory Management Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.5
### Description: Integrate inventory management to monitor and control input and output stocks for each batch.
### Details:
Track inventory usage and availability for seeds, feed, and other consumables linked to each batch.

## 7. Batch Labeling and Identification [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.5
### Description: Implement a labeling system for clear identification and traceability of each batch.
### Details:
Assign unique labels or codes to batches for tracking, reporting, and compliance purposes.

## 8. Analytics and Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.4, 18.5, 18.6, 18.7
### Description: Develop analytics dashboards and reports to evaluate batch performance and inform decision-making.
### Details:
Aggregate data from all previous subtasks to provide insights on productivity, resource utilization, and yield trends.
