# Task ID: 41
# Title: Fix ESLint and Prettier Issues Across Frontend Codebase
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27, 37
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve all ESLint and Prettier errors and warnings in the frontend codebase to ensure git commits can be made without bypassing pre-commit hooks.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current state of linting issues:
   - Run ESLint across the entire frontend codebase with `npx eslint --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx src/`
   - Run Prettier check with `npx prettier --check "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,scss}"`
   - Document all types of errors and warnings found, categorizing them by severity and frequency
   - Identify patterns in the issues to determine if there are systemic problems

2. Update configuration if necessary:
   - Review current ESLint and Prettier configurations
   - Ensure rules are appropriate for the project's needs
   - Resolve any conflicts between ESLint and Prettier rules
   - Consider adding the `eslint-config-prettier` to disable ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier

3. Create a prioritized plan for fixes:
   - Address critical errors first (those preventing builds or causing runtime issues)
   - Group similar issues that can be fixed with the same approach
   - Create a schedule for batched fixes to avoid massive PRs

4. Implement automated fixes where possible:
   - Use `npx eslint --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx src/ --fix` for auto-fixable issues
   - Use `npx prettier --write "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,scss}"` for formatting issues
   - Document which issues require manual intervention

5. Address manual fixes systematically:
   - Fix issues by component or module to maintain context
   - Address one type of issue at a time across the codebase
   - Document patterns used for fixes to maintain consistency

6. Update developer documentation:
   - Document common linting issues and how to avoid them
   - Create a style guide based on the ESLint and Prettier configurations
   - Add information about the pre-commit hooks and their purpose

7. Implement or improve IDE integration:
   - Ensure VSCode/WebStorm settings are documented for the team
   - Create workspace settings files if appropriate
   - Configure editor plugins for real-time linting feedback

8. Review and test fixes:
   - Ensure no functionality was broken during linting fixes
   - Verify that git commits work without the `--no-verify` flag
   - Run the full test suite to catch any regressions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verification of linting status:
   - Run `npx eslint --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx src/` and confirm zero errors and warnings
   - Run `npx prettier --check "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,scss}"` and confirm all files match the expected format
   - Verify that running both commands in CI environment passes successfully

2. Pre-commit hook testing:
   - Make changes to various frontend files
   - Attempt to commit changes without the `--no-verify` flag
   - Verify that the commit succeeds without errors
   - Intentionally introduce linting errors and verify that the commit is blocked

3. Regression testing:
   - Run the full frontend test suite to ensure no functionality was broken
   - Manually test key components and features that had significant linting fixes
   - Verify that the application builds successfully with production settings

4. Documentation testing:
   - Have a team member follow the updated style guide for a new component
   - Verify that their code passes linting without issues
   - Test IDE integration by having team members use the documented settings

5. Performance verification:
   - Measure the time it takes for the linting process to complete before and after fixes
   - Ensure that the pre-commit hooks execute within a reasonable timeframe
   - Verify that the development experience (hot reloading, etc.) is not negatively impacted
