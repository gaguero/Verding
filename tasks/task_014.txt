# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Home Assistant Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the integration with Home Assistant for sensor data collection, monitoring, and control of environmental conditions.
# Details:
1. Create MQTT bridge for Home Assistant connection
2. Implement secure authentication with long-lived access tokens
3. Develop automatic sensor discovery and configuration
4. Create data collection system for environmental metrics
5. Implement time-series storage for sensor readings
6. Create alerting system for threshold violations
7. Develop visualization components for sensor data
8. Implement connection health monitoring

Use MQTT.js 4.3+ for MQTT communication. Support Home Assistant's auto-discovery protocol. Implement proper time-series optimization in the database for efficient storage and querying of sensor data.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test MQTT connection and authentication
2. Validate sensor discovery and configuration
3. Test data collection and storage
4. Verify alerting system with threshold violations
5. Test visualization components
6. Validate connection health monitoring
7. Benchmark performance with high-frequency data
8. Test recovery from connection interruptions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up MQTT Broker and Bridge [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure the primary MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto) and set up an MQTT bridge if multiple brokers are needed for sensor data aggregation.
### Details:
Ensure the broker is accessible to Home Assistant and configure bridging if integrating data from multiple sources. Modify the broker configuration file as needed to enable bridging.

## 2. Configure MQTT Integration in Home Assistant [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Add and configure the MQTT integration in Home Assistant, specifying broker address, port, and credentials.
### Details:
Navigate to Home Assistant Settings > Devices & Services, add the MQTT integration, and provide the broker details. Adjust advanced options if SSL or certificate validation is required.

## 3. Implement Authentication and Security [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Set up authentication for the MQTT broker and Home Assistant integration, including username, password, and optional SSL/TLS.
### Details:
Configure user accounts and passwords on the broker. Enable SSL/TLS if required for secure communication between Home Assistant and the broker.

## 4. Enable and Configure MQTT Sensor Discovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Set up MQTT discovery to allow Home Assistant to automatically detect and add sensors published via MQTT.
### Details:
Ensure MQTT discovery is enabled in Home Assistant and configure devices to publish discovery topics with unique identifiers and correct payload structure.

## 5. Develop Sensor Data Collection Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Implement or configure devices/services to publish sensor data to the MQTT broker using appropriate topics and payload formats.
### Details:
Ensure all relevant sensors are publishing data to the broker and that topics align with Home Assistant's discovery and entity requirements.

## 6. Integrate Time-Series Data Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.5
### Description: Configure Home Assistant or an external database to store incoming sensor data as time-series for historical analysis.
### Details:
Set up Home Assistant's built-in recorder or integrate with external databases (e.g., InfluxDB) for efficient time-series storage.

## 7. Set Up Alerting and Notification Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define automations or scripts in Home Assistant to trigger alerts based on sensor data thresholds or anomalies.
### Details:
Configure notification channels (e.g., mobile app, email) and create rules for alerting on critical sensor events.

## 8. Implement Visualization and Health Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create dashboards for real-time and historical sensor data visualization and set up health monitoring for the integration.
### Details:
Use Home Assistant's Lovelace UI or third-party tools for dashboards. Monitor integration health, broker connectivity, and sensor status.
