1. Test structured logging format
2. Validate error tracking and reporting
3. Test metrics collection accuracy
4. Verify alerting and notifications
5. Test user behavior analytics
6. Validate performance monitoring
7. Test log aggregation and search
8. Verify KPI dashboard accuracy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Structured Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up structured logging across all services using a machine-readable format (e.g., JSON), ensuring logs are easily searchable and analyzable.
### Details:
Choose and configure a logging framework that supports structured logging, such as log4j, Serilog, or bunyan, and ensure integration with centralized logging services.

## 2. Set Up Error Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Integrate error tracking tools to capture, categorize, and alert on application errors and exceptions.
### Details:
Configure error tracking solutions (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to collect error data and link it with structured logs for context.

## 3. Configure Metrics Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Instrument services to collect operational and business metrics, such as request rates, error rates, and custom KPIs.
### Details:
Use metrics libraries (e.g., Prometheus client, Micrometer) to expose and collect relevant metrics from all components.

## 4. Establish Alerting Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.2, 36.3
### Description: Set up alerting rules and notification channels based on logs, errors, and metrics to ensure timely response to incidents.
### Details:
Define thresholds and conditions for alerts, and configure integrations with communication tools (e.g., Slack, email, PagerDuty).

## 5. Integrate User Analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Implement user analytics tracking to monitor user behavior, engagement, and feature usage.
### Details:
Integrate analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel) and ensure events are logged in a structured format for correlation with system logs.

## 6. Develop Performance Dashboards [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.3
### Description: Create dashboards to visualize system and application performance metrics in real time.
### Details:
Use dashboard tools (e.g., Grafana, Kibana) to present key performance indicators and trends for operational visibility.

## 7. Implement Log Aggregation [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Aggregate logs from all services into a centralized platform for unified search, analysis, and retention.
### Details:
Set up log shippers (e.g., Filebeat, Fluentd) and configure a log aggregation solution (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Graylog).

## 8. Build KPI Dashboards [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.3, 36.5
### Description: Design and deploy dashboards focused on business and product KPIs for stakeholders.
### Details:
Identify key business metrics, integrate data sources, and visualize KPIs using dashboard tools for decision-making.
