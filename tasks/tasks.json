Current workspace configuration is functional with npm workspaces and Turborepo pipeline properly set up.\n\n2. Package versioning requires a decision between:\n   - Synchronized versioning across all packages\n   - Independent versioning for each package\n\n3. Dependency update management options:\n   - Renovate: Automated PRs with smart grouping\n   - Dependabot: GitHub native solution\n   - Manual management\n\n4. Shared library organization alternatives:\n   - Monolithic shared package\n   - Domain-specific packages (@verding/types, @verding/ui, etc.)\n   - Hybrid approach\n\n5. Build cache optimization strategies:\n   - Aggressive caching for speed\n   - Conservative caching for reliability\n   - Selective caching based on package type\n\nThese decisions will impact our development workflow, release management, and overall project maintainability.

Synchronized Versioning: Configuring all packages to share the same version number using Lerna with fixed mode. This will simplify release management and ensure compatibility.\n\n2. Renovate Integration: Setting up Renovate with monorepo-specific configuration including:\n   - Smart grouping of dependencies\n   - Scheduled updates to minimize disruption\n   - Auto-merging of non-breaking patches\n\n3. Hybrid Shared Library Structure:\n   - Creating core @verding/shared package for common utilities\n   - Establishing specialized packages (@verding/ui, @verding/api) for domain-specific code\n   - Implementing proper cross-package imports with TypeScript path aliases\n\n4.

Multi-Tenancy Isolation**\n- **Complete data separation**: Property-based isolation across all operational data\n- **No cross-property leakage**: Users cannot access other properties' data\n- **Hierarchical properties**: Support for property parent-child relationships\n\n#### **2. Role-Based Access Control**\n- **Granular permissions**: view, edit, manage permissions per property\n- **Role hierarchy**: owner > admin > manager > employee > viewer > client\n- **Permission inheritance**: Higher roles include lower role permissions\n\n#### **3. Operation-Specific Security**\n- **Read operations**: Require view permissions\n- **Write operations**: Require edit permissions\n- **Administrative operations**: Require manage permissions\n- **System operations**: Require super admin status\n\n#### **4. Data Ownership Patterns**\n- **User-owned data**: Profiles, sessions, personal conversations\n- **Property-owned data**: Batches, orders, customers, tasks\n- **Shared data**: Crop varieties, public documentation\n- **System data**: Audit logs, system configurations\n\n### ✅ PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS\n\n#### **1. Function Optimization**\n- **Security functions**: Marked as SECURITY DEFINER for privilege elevation\n- **Caching**: PostgreSQL caches function results within transactions\n- **Index support**: All security checks use indexed columns\n\n#### **2.

Identify n8n Monitoring Capabilities\n- Research n8n's built-in monitoring, logging, and alerting features.\n- Explore n8n documentation for best practices on capturing workflow metrics and logs.\n- Look for potential integrations with external monitoring tools if n8n's native capabilities are limited.\n\n### 2. Integrate with Supabase for Logging and Metrics Storage\n- Leverage the existing `error_logs` table and general logging setup in Supabase.\n- Design a new table (e.g., `n8n_workflow_metrics`) in Supabase to store performance data (execution duration, success/failure rates, API call response times).\n- Plan to use the Supabase node within n8n workflows to insert relevant logs and metrics data into these tables.\n\n### 3. Define Key Metrics and Alerting Thresholds\n- **Workflow Execution**: Monitor success/failure rates, average execution time, and number of triggered workflows.\n- **API Call Performance**: Track response times and error rates for critical API calls made from n8n (e.g., to our backend, external services).\n- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor n8n instance CPU, memory, and disk usage (if self-hosted) or rely on n8n Cloud's monitoring.\n- **Thresholds**: Define specific thresholds for each metric that should trigger an alert (e.g., 5% error rate, 500ms average response time).\n\n### 4. Configure Alerting Channels in n8n\n- Utilize n8n's built-in notification nodes (e.g., Email, Telegram, Slack) to send alerts when thresholds are breached.\n- Design alert messages to be informative, including workflow name, metric, current value, and threshold.\n- Consider setting up an HTTP Request node to send alerts to a custom alerting service if needed for more advanced features (e.g., on-call rotation).\n\n### 5. Plan for Monitoring Dashboard/Visualization (Future Consideration)\n- Explore how to visualize the collected metrics and logs from Supabase.\n- Potentially use Supabase's built-in dashboard tools or integrate with a third-party BI tool to create custom dashboards for comprehensive operational oversight.

Update configuration if necessary:\n   - Review current ESLint and Prettier configurations\n   - Ensure rules are appropriate for the project's needs\n   - Resolve any conflicts between ESLint and Prettier rules\n   - Consider adding the `eslint-config-prettier` to disable ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier\n\n3. Create a prioritized plan for fixes:\n   - Address critical errors first (those preventing builds or causing runtime issues)\n   - Group similar issues that can be fixed with the same approach\n   - Create a schedule for batched fixes to avoid massive PRs\n\n4. Implement automated fixes where possible:\n   - Use `npx eslint --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx src/ --fix` for auto-fixable issues\n   - Use `npx prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,scss}\"` for formatting issues\n   - Document which issues require manual intervention\n\n5. Address manual fixes systematically:\n   - Fix issues by component or module to maintain context\n   - Address one type of issue at a time across the codebase\n   - Document patterns used for fixes to maintain consistency\n\n6. Update developer documentation:\n   - Document common linting issues and how to avoid them\n   - Create a style guide based on the ESLint and Prettier configurations\n   - Add information about the pre-commit hooks and their purpose\n\n7. Implement or improve IDE integration:\n   - Ensure VSCode/WebStorm settings are documented for the team\n   - Create workspace settings files if appropriate\n   - Configure editor plugins for real-time linting feedback\n\n8. Review and test fixes:\n   - Ensure no functionality was broken during linting fixes\n   - Verify that git commits work without the `--no-verify` flag\n   - Run the full test suite to catch any regressions",

Pre-commit hook testing:\n   - Make changes to various frontend files\n   - Attempt to commit changes without the `--no-verify` flag\n   - Verify that the commit succeeds without errors\n   - Intentionally introduce linting errors and verify that the commit is blocked\n\n3. Regression testing:\n   - Run the full frontend test suite to ensure no functionality was broken\n   - Manually test key components and features that had significant linting fixes\n   - Verify that the application builds successfully with production settings\n\n4. Documentation testing:\n   - Have a team member follow the updated style guide for a new component\n   - Verify that their code passes linting without issues\n   - Test IDE integration by having team members use the documented settings\n\n5. Performance verification:\n   - Measure the time it takes for the linting process to complete before and after fixes\n   - Ensure that the pre-commit hooks execute within a reasonable timeframe\n   - Verify that the development experience (hot reloading, etc.) is not negatively impacted",
