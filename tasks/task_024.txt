# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Document Processing System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the document processing system for handling multi-format documents, text extraction, and metadata management.
# Details:
1. Create document data model and storage
2. Implement multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
3. Create text extraction and processing
4. Implement metadata management
5. Create version control system
6. Implement document categorization and tagging
7. Create search and retrieval system
8. Develop document analytics and reporting

Use libraries like pdf.js, mammoth.js, and textract for document parsing. Implement proper text extraction with layout preservation where possible. Create a metadata system that captures document properties, tags, and relationships.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test document upload and storage
2. Validate format support and conversion
3. Test text extraction accuracy
4. Verify metadata management
5. Test version control
6. Validate categorization and tagging
7. Test search and retrieval
8. Verify analytics and reporting
