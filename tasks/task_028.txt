# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Mobile App Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the foundation for the native mobile applications with React Native, including authentication, navigation, and core components.
# Details:
1. Setup React Native application with Expo
2. Implement navigation system
3. Create authentication flows and protected screens
4. Implement state management with Context/React Query
5. Create base UI components following design system
6. Implement error handling and notifications
7. Create loading states and skeleton screens
8. Develop offline capability foundation

Use React Native 0.72+ with Expo SDK 49+. Implement navigation with React Navigation 6+. Create a component library following the brand guidelines with appropriate adaptations for mobile platforms. Implement proper handling of device capabilities like camera, notifications, and biometrics.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test on iOS and Android devices
2. Validate navigation system
3. Test authentication flows
4. Verify state management
5. Test UI components in isolation
6. Validate error handling and notifications
7. Test loading states and transitions
8. Verify offline capability

# Subtasks:
