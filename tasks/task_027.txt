# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Web Frontend Core
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core web frontend application with responsive design, authentication flows, and base components. This task is CRITICAL for user's ability to observe development progress visually.
# Details:
1. Setup React application with TypeScript
2. Implement responsive layout system
3. Create authentication flows and protected routes
4. Implement state management with Context/React Query
5. Create base UI components following design system
6. Implement error handling and notifications
7. Create loading states and skeleton screens
8. Develop offline capability foundation

Use React 18.2+ with TypeScript. Implement responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox. Create a component library following the brand guidelines with Earth Green (#2C5545) as primary color, Sage (#7A9B76) as secondary, and Teal (#00A896) as accent.

**USER REQUIREMENTS:**
- Web interface available as soon as possible for visual observation
- Both automated tests AND manual testing through web interface
- User should be able to see and interact with progress after every subtask
- Run tests after every subtask completion

**IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:**
- Prioritize getting a basic visual interface running early
- Focus on making progress visible and testable
- Implement testing capabilities alongside development
- Ensure user can observe what's being developed

**DECISION POINTS:**
1. **Framework Choice**: React vs Vue vs Angular - REQUIRES USER INPUT
2. **State Management**: Redux vs Zustand vs Context API - REQUIRES USER INPUT  
3. **UI Framework**: Material-UI vs Chakra UI vs Custom - REQUIRES USER INPUT
4. **Testing Framework**: Jest vs Vitest, Cypress vs Playwright - REQUIRES USER INPUT

# Test Strategy:
1. Test responsive layout on various devices
2. Validate authentication flows
3. Test protected route access control
4. Verify state management
5. Test UI components in isolation
6. Validate error handling and notifications
7. Test loading states and transitions
8. Verify offline capability

**TESTING STRATEGY:**
- Automated: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
- Manual: Web interface for visual verification
- Frequency: After every subtask completion
- Visibility: User observes development progress
- Present testing results to user after each subtask

# Subtasks:
