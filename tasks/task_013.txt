# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Natural Language Processing Core
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the NLP core that will process user messages, understand intent, and generate appropriate responses across all communication channels.
# Details:
1. Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 API for natural language understanding
2. Create prompt engineering system for domain-specific understanding
3. Implement context management for conversations
4. Create intent classification system
5. Develop entity extraction for microgreens terminology
6. Implement response generation with appropriate formatting
7. Create error clarification and recovery mechanisms
8. Setup multilingual support foundation (English MVP, Spanish future)

Use OpenAI API with gpt-4-turbo or newer models. Implement proper prompt engineering with few-shot examples for microgreens domain. Create a context window management system to handle token limitations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test intent recognition with various phrasings
2. Validate entity extraction accuracy
3. Test context maintenance across multiple turns
4. Verify response quality and relevance
5. Test error recovery with ambiguous inputs
6. Benchmark processing time for various inputs
7. Validate domain-specific understanding
8. Test handling of out-of-domain queries
