|-----------|----------------------------|------------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|------------------|---------------|------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Popcorn** | 200g | 21g | Coco Coir | 12 Hours | Yes | 15 lbs | 5 days | 3 days | 0 days | 8 days | Intermediate | Bury the seed to prevent mold from occurring. Must be kept in the dark for the entirety of the grow to prevent from turning green. |
| **Chia, Black** | 12g | 1.26g | Coco Coir | None | No | None (Do Not Stack) | 3 days | 2 days | 3 days | 8 days | Advanced | None |

| **Beet, Detroit Dark Red** | 45g | 4.725g | Coco Coir | None | Yes | 15 lbs | 5 days | - | 5 days | 10 days | Advanced | Bury the seed to keep the hull from being brought up into the canopy. Weight also helps to keep the coco coir from lifting into the crop. |
| **Wheatgrass** | 200g | 21g | Coco Coir | 8 Hours | No | None (Do Not Stack) | 3 days | - | 5 days | 8 days | Intermediate | Use as little water as possible to prevent mold. Possible to keep growing after first cut, however noticeable imperfection will exist. Second cut good for juicing. |
| **Chard, Rainbow Swiss** | 60g | 6.3g | Coco Coir | None | Yes | 15 lbs | 5 days | - | 5 days | 10 days | Advanced | Bury the seed to keep the hull from being brought up into the canopy. Weight also helps to keep the coco coir from lifting up into the crop. |

| **Amaranth, Red Garnet** | 8g | 0.84g | Coco Coir | None | No | None (Do Not Stack) | 3 days | 2 days | - | 14-28 days | Intermediate | You can harvest this as early as Day 14, however if you wait this crop out, it does get much larger. Some like to wait until Day 28 to harvest! |
| **Basil, Genovese** | 10g | 1.05g | Coco Coir | None | No | 15 lbs | 5 days | 5 days | - | 21-28 days | Intermediate | After several tests, we found it is beneficial to keep weight on basil. It really helps to drive down the roots. Be sure not to lift the tray during germination due to the seeds being mucilaginous. They will stop sticking around Day 5. |
| **Basil, Opal** | 10g | 1.05g | Coco Coir | None | No | 15 lbs | 5 days | 5 days | - | 21-28 days | Intermediate | After several tests, we found it is beneficial to keep weight on basil. It really helps to drive down the roots. Be sure not to lift the tray during germination due to the seeds being mucilaginous. They will stop sticking around Day 5. |
| **Basil, Lemon** | 10g | 1.05g | Coco Coir | None | No | 15 lbs | 5 days | 5 days | - | 21-28 days | Intermediate | After several tests, we found it is beneficial to keep weight on basil. It really helps to drive down the roots. Be sure not to lift the tray during germination due to the seeds being mucilaginous. They will stop sticking around Day 5. |
| **Celery** | 20g | 2.1g | Coco Coir | None | No | None (Do Not Stack) | 10 days | 7 days | - | 21-28 days | Advanced | Must mist this everyday in germination. |
| **Carrot** | 20g | 2.1g | Coco Coir | None | Yes | 15 lbs | 5 days | 5 days | - | 21-28 days | Intermediate | We found that covering the seeds with a thin layer of soil on top, helps to shed the hull off the crop. |
