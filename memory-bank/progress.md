# Verding Project Progress

## Overall Project Status: 10% Complete
**Current Phase**: **Phase 1: Secure Foundation & User Authentication**

Our development strategy has shifted from building a component library to a feature-driven approach. We will build pages and features vertically to deliver a usable application faster.

## High-Level Development Roadmap

### üéØ **Phase 1: Secure Foundation & User Authentication (Current Focus)**
- **Goal**: Implement the complete authentication loop so users can securely log in and out.
- **Status**: **In Progress**
- **Key Tasks**:
    - [x] Implement Login/Registration Flow using existing components.
    - [x] Establish main application routes (`/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`).
    - [x] Protect the `/dashboard` route.
    - [x] Build out the main `Layout.tsx` component with navigation placeholders.
    - [x] Implement logout functionality.

### **Phase 2: The Core Dashboard - Viewing Farm State**
- **Goal**: Allow a logged-in user to select a property and see relevant, real-time data.
- **Status**: **Not Started**
- **Key Tasks**:
    - [ ] Rebuild the `Card` component.
    - [ ] Build the `PropertySwitcher` component and integrate with `propertyStore`.
    - [ ] Rebuild the `SensorCard` component and connect to backend data.

### **Phase 3: Initial Interaction & Data Management**
- **Goal**: Enable users to begin managing their core farm data.
- **Status**: **Not Started**
- **Key Tasks**:
    - [ ] Rebuild the `ResourcePanel` to show equipment/supplies.
    - [ ] Create an "Add Crop" feature, building required form components (`Input`, `Select`, etc.) as needed.
    - [ ] Connect the form to the backend API.

## Recent Major Milestones

### ‚úÖ **Achieved Stable Build & Development Environment**
- **Accomplishment**: We successfully resolved all build errors across the monorepo.
- **Impact**: The application is now runnable, providing a stable foundation for feature development.
- **Action Taken**: Stripped down the `DashboardPage.tsx` to a minimal state and installed missing type definitions for the backend.

###  pivotal-moment **Strategic Pivot to Feature-Driven Development**
- **Decision**: Abandoned the "component-library-first" approach.
- **New Strategy**: We will now build features and pages in vertical slices, creating components as they are needed. This is expected to significantly accelerate the delivery of a usable product.

### ‚úÖ **Authentication UI Styled & Integrated**
- **Accomplishment**: Created CSS Modules for Login, Register, and Layout with design tokens; enhanced global form control styles; replaced raw elements with unified `<Button>` and `<Link>` components.
- **Impact**: Auth pages now fully styled, responsive, and consistent with the UX/UI Style Guide.

## Technical State

### üîß **Frontend**
- Authentication pages (`/login`, `/register`) are styled and functional using CSS Modules and design tokens.
- Protected routing (`/dashboard`) and logout flow are implemented.
- Global form controls and `<Button>` components now follow the design system best practices.
- Dashboard page is ready for the next phase of implementation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Backend**
- The backend is buildable and stable.
- Type definition issues have been resolved.

**Next Session Goal**: Begin Phase 2: Build the core dashboard with property selection and real-time sensor data integration.
