# Project Brief: Verding

## Project Overview

Verding is an agent-first microgreens management platform that revolutionizes
agricultural operations through natural language interaction. The system enables
users to manage their entire microgreens operation through conversational
commands across multiple channels (Telegram, WhatsApp, email, web, mobile).

## Core Mission

Create the world's most intuitive and efficient microgreens management system
that enables growers to focus on cultivation rather than software complexity,
accessible through natural conversation in any language, on any device, at any
scale.

## Key Differentiators

- **Agent-First Architecture**: Primary interaction through AI-powered
  conversational agent
- **Multi-Property Support**: Manage 1 to infinite farms/locations from a single
  instance
- **Hybrid Memory System**: Sophisticated RAG implementation for context-aware
  interactions
- **BuJo Task Management**: Bullet Journal-inspired task tracking system
- **Real-Time Sensor Integration**: Automated environmental monitoring via Home
  Assistant
- **Comprehensive GUI Alternative**: Full visual interface with feature parity
  to agent

## Primary Objectives

1. **Reduce Manual Data Entry**: 80% reduction in manual input through agent
   automation
2. **Improve Operational Efficiency**: 50% time savings in daily management
   tasks
3. **Enable Data-Driven Decisions**: Real-time insights and predictive analytics
4. **Ensure Compliance**: Automated GAP compliance record generation
5. **Scale Operations**: Support growth from single-tray to industrial
   operations
6. **Democratize Access**: Make advanced farm management accessible to all skill
   levels

## Success Metrics

- Capture 25% of tech-forward microgreens operations within 3 years
- Enable 10x growth for existing customers without proportional complexity
  increase
- Reduce crop failure rates by 40% through predictive monitoring
- Achieve 95% customer retention through superior user experience

## Project Scope

This is a comprehensive platform with 40 main tasks and 317 subtasks covering:

- Infrastructure setup (Supabase, n8n, deployment)
- Agent core with NLP and multi-channel support
- Multi-property management system
- Production tracking (sowing, harvest, delivery)
- Customer and order management
- Security, monitoring, and documentation

## Current Status

- Project initialized with Task Master
- 40 main tasks generated from PRD
- 39/40 tasks expanded into detailed subtasks (317 total)
- Individual task files generated
- Ready to begin implementation
